# Arch Linux for NanoPi NEO2 board
The images are made using the great work by @mbouron found [here](https://github.com/mbouron/archlinuxarm-nanopi-neo2).
This is for those who don't or can't download and install crosstool-ng or other dependencies.

Login/passwords are root/root and alaram/alarm.
This is an unmodified -current arch linux rootfs and written to a 1.5GB image file.
Create sd card with something like Etcher and then resize the partion on your sd card, gparted is great for it.

Good luck, and have fun!
